# Breast Cancer Research Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict diabetes-related outcomes using various machine learning algorithms. The research is conducted in Python, leveraging popular data science libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. The project also includes a research paper detailing the methodology, experiments, and findings.

## AIM
Breast cancer diagnosis in medicine also makes use of machine learning. In order to direct future directions that may result in increases in patient safety, the current study looked at past patterns in breast cancer treatment for diabetic patients admitted to various hospitals. In this case study, we examine how machine learning might help distinguish between tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous)

## Conclusion 
According to the investigation and findings, a machine learning algorithm can reliably classify breast cancer and determine if a patient has the disease or not. The investigation found that not all algorithms were able to improve after optimization; this can be attributed to the small sample space of data used to train the algorithm, but some algorithms did improve. To make better use of this outcome, deploying the best performing algorithm to the cloud would require the assistance of a surgical oncologist and allow for cross-hospital use of the results.
